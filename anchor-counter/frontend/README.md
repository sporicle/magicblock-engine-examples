# Ephemeral Counter UI

This is a React-based UI for the Ephemeral Counter program, which is part of the documentation for integrating with the Ephemeral Rollups.

## Overview

The UI demonstrates the use of Solana's ephemeral rollups with a simple counter program. It showcases an `increment` instruction that can run both on the main network and ephemeral rollup.

This example shows a minimal web page for interacting with MagicBlock networks.
It creates a local wallet in the browser and lets you airdrop funds on the
selected network and send a no-op transaction using the **Ping** button.

Open `index.html` in a browser to try it out. Use the network selector to switch
between **Devnet** and the **Ephemeral Rollup**.
